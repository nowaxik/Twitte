# Twitte
Twitte is a simple clone of the popular social networking site Twitter. It is currently in Beta version without much security. If you have any comments write to me, I will be grateful for all suggestions, even the negative ones. 

Installation

Place the files in a local directory if you are using software that imitates a server (for example: xampp, lamp) or upload the files to an external server and place them in the appropriate directory. 

Then type in your browser the appropriate address to your local server (http://localhost/) or the external server (your apache2 server address).

If all the files have been properly transferred to the server your eyes should see the form for logging into the service. Below the form there are two links Registration and Installation. Click the Installation link. 

After clicking the appropriate link you will be taken to the installation form. Fill in all the fields: 

1. server address
2. database name
3. database user name
4. database user password

If all the fields have been filled in correctly, the whole installation should go without any problems, and you will see the information that the installation was successful. After a successful installation it is time to register your profile.

User account registration

In the previous step we installed the service, now it's time to create your first account. Go to the login page, and then under the form click on the link Registration. 

A form will appear in which you must fill in all the fields: 

1. Login 
2. Password
3. name that will be displayed (for example: first and last name)
4. email address
5. Date of birth

If all the fields have been filled in correctly, the whole registration process should pass without any problems and you will be taken to the login page where you will be able to log in to the service for the first time.
